impact:

   	-Ideal imace occur slightly in front of batter.
	-Accleration close to 0. 
        -Angular velocity near impact should be close to constant since front arm
        should be straight or near straight, hips @ center of rotation(origin).
	
	-@ impact, bat speed slows, therefor acceleration < 0
	-bat will oscilate along the y axis.
	-depending on placement of sensors acceleration and angular velocty will oscilate
